# skel-js
This is a collection of what I intend to be minimal, loosely coupled, vanilla js libraries for various purposes. These are largely exercises and experiments that put into practice things that I'm thinking about and learning about, but they may also be useful, so here they are.

## Structure

Each library is in its own folder. If any of them are actually useful, I hope eventually to implement them as npm packages, so they should be installable through that. Otherwise, of course, most of them are single files and can easily be copied into existing projects.

I considered using git's submodule architecture, but it doesn't seem to make sense, as it doesn't really have the full range of features that a package system should have.
